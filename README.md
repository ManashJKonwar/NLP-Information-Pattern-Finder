# NLP-Information-Pattern-Finder
> The entire repository encourages finding hidden patterns from unsupervised text and also generate relationships among entities which are existing within the text corpus. The implementation would be completely spacy based and would help researchers, developers, etc to extraction valuable insights from text content. This approach could be scaled for different other use cases such as resume harvesting, media analysis, product feedback analysis, email scans, etc. In this repository, we will try to gather insights for 5 different news categories which are covered by BBC namely - sports, technology, politics, business and entertainment.  

The prime objective of this repository is to build generic pipelines for text preprocessing, information extraction based on generic rules and paving the way towards initial drafts of knowledge graphs.
